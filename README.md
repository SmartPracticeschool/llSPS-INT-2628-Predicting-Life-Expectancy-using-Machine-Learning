# Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning
# INTRODUCTION:


Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors.
This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given in a dataset.
A Supervised Machine learning Regression algorithm with maximum accuracy which is trained and tested on the dataset works as the base model.The Project requires in depth knowledge of IBM Services. The User Interface is built on Node-Red which is an IBM Application and the backend uses Machine Learning Algorithm which is a typical Regression Model. 
Software Requirements: IBM Cloud ,IBM Watson Studio,Node-red .
Project delivers a user interface which works on machine learning to predict the life expectancy by taking an input dataset consisting of all the various attributes that affect the model and observations to train it and provide accurate results.

# PURPOSE
The purpose is to provide a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.

# PROPOSED SOLUTION:
The solution encourages the creation of a regression model which, by taking various features from the dataset, into consideration gives the best possible algorithm to predict the Life Expectancy accurately.
The solution is predicted by forming models using both python and Auto AI, made with the help of various Watson Services available on the IBM Cloud platform. After proper training, testing and deployment of the models, a User Interface is made on node-red which takes in the input , uses the proposed model in the backend and provides the output there itself.
